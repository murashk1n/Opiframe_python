## TradeStrategy and TradestrategyOptimizer
In this example, the program takes data from a text file, and not from the exchange directly. The program is not optimized and is just an example.

To work with files you need to install the following libraries

``` bash
pip install backtrader
```
``` bash
pip install matplolib
```
